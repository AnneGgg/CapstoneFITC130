         <h2>Forms of Loss</h2>
         <p>Loss can come in many forms</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Loss of a loved one</li>
               <li>Loss of a relationship</li>
               <li>Loss of a lifestyle</li>
            </ul>
         <p>My experience is about the loss of a loved one.</p>
         
         <h2>After the Loss</h2>
         <p>In the beginning, it was very important to focus on simple tasks to keep me distracted and to help move into my new reality.</p>
         <p>My basic routine became:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Get up</li>
               <li>Get dressed</li>
               <li>Eat breakfast</li>
               <li>Go outside, preferably for a walk</li>
               <li>Eat supper</li>
            </ol>
         <p>Every day, I made sure to at least do these things. Eating was so hard, food was tasteless; I have not eaten cardboard, but I am sure that is similar to what it was like to eat. It took a long time for food to actually have noticeable flavour again.
         </p>
         <p> 
         Going outside everyday helped a lot - it was a distraction from my surroundings, as well as a chance for life to feel normal again. Some days, walking felt like the best thing to do, so I would go on extra walks.
         </p>
         <p>
         Getting up and getting dressed seem pretty basic, but in my state, I would have probably lived in my pajamas. Doing this also helped life feel a little more normal. 
         </p>
